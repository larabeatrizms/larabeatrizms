# Hello, dev! :speech_balloon:

I build cool applications with JavaScript and Typescript. Lately, I'm making many useful things with ReactJS, React Native and Node.js. I am passionate about technology, i'm in the penultimate period of computer engineering at the University of Rio Grande do Norte and development ambassador (ReactJS, React Native and Node.js) at [Rocketseat](rocketseat.com.br):rocket:.

Currently, I am working at [Smartenvios](https://smartenvios.com/):package: as a fullstack developer. If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LaraBeatrizMS2). Looking forward to connecting with you 👋🏻
