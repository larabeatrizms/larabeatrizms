# Hello, dev!

I build cool applications with JavaScript and Typescript. Lately, I'm making many useful things with **ReactJS, React Native, Go** and **Node.js**. I am passionate about technology, I graduated from the University of Rio Grande do Norte in computer engineering.

Currently, I am working at [Smartenvios](https://smartenvios.com/) as a **Lead Backend Engineer**. If you would like to discuss these things, you can send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LaraBeatrizMS). Looking forward to connecting with you 👋🏻
